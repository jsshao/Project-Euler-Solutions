These are my solutions to Project Euler problems found on projecteuler.net

I'm currently trying to complete one problem a day on average.

My belief is that most programming problems can be solved efficiently and elegantly using principles of mathematics.

I understand that some solutions may require a high level of mathematics. If anything is unclear, feel free to email me at jsshao@uwaterloo.ca
